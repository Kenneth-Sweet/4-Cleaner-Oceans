			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<div id="about-text">
				4 Cleaner Oceans became a non-profit organization in 2013 in Jekyll 
				Island, a popular beach in South Glynn County, Georgia.  This area has 
				a critical barrier island ecosystem that the community greatly wanted 
				to preserve.  In 2016, 4 Cleaner Oceans expanded its projects to include 
				beach cleanups throughout Georgia and the Carolinas.  With over 65 beach 
				cleanup projects a year, the organization has outgrown its simple paper 
				and spreadsheet organizational system and seeks the creation of a more 
				sophisticated database management system to keep track of its projects, 
				donors, and volunteers.  This will allow the organization to eventually 
				expand its reach and increase the number of projects, and with it, the 
				health of our oceans.
